## Paper Prototype

- Identify a game concept 
- Think about the components in that system
    - What are their state?
- Identify the core system loop
    - Faucets, sinks, exchanges
- Write down adequate enough rules that others can play your game (online document)
- Consider player goals
- Have someone play your game, observe the system in action
- Correctly identify your mechanics and dynamics, theme the aesthethics

## Digital Prototype

- Explore a game mechanic (what is one you like in games you have played?)
- Focus on juice / feel
- Consider meaning / intention in this game
- Develop a design document to situate this mechanic in a broader scheme of a game design?
- Relate short to long term goals, align with system


## Group Prototype 1

- Get a full loop of a system 
- Add a bit of juice to the game
- Focus on exploring the "vibe" your group formed around
- Write up a design doc that situates this prototype in a larger context ( player goals, player fantasy, unique selling point )
- Explain this concept in one tweets-length


## Group Prototype 2

- Explore the imposed limitation
- Prototype one full system loop
- Identify and integrate appropriate external resources into your project
- Make sure some juice is added to this game
- Identify one type of "fun" present in this game and expand upon it in a written document



## Game selection

1)

- What are the most compelling concepts? ( the "spark" )
- Where is the best alignment between goals and system?
- Which are the most likely to make money? ( steam spy / genre exploration / voting )

2)

- Apply to work on a limited set of games
