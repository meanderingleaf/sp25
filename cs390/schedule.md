## Weekly Check ins

- Every group member must have 1 item submitted to the git repo
- A group leader pulls from that repo, makes a build of their game, and uploads it to itch.io
- A slide is added to the group development log that contains
    - New additions this week
    - A screenshot from the current build of the game
- This slide is presented to the class
- Each group member adds one paragraph detailing what they worked on this week to their development log
- Groups look at, reflect upon their tasks, add new ones as necessary


## Milestone process

Step back and analyze (in a written report):
- Development velocity
- Communication strategy
- Priotiziation of features
- Reuseability / modularity of features
- Task load
- Perceived fun
- Match between player goals and system

Then:

- Add fun
    - Consider where a new element can be reuseable / affect the system
- Polish existing fun
- Remove frustration
    - Cut / redesign a feature
- Redo assignments / task board
    - Continue to consider how SMART these goals are


## Playtest process

With a build of your game uploaded to itch.io (and password protected)
** Playtests may sometimes take place outside of normal class hours. Keep an eye on your email for when these opportunities occur.

- Get peers to download and access your game ( a web build is preferrable, when possible )
- *watch them* during the gameplay. Take active notes. Look for misunderstanding, moments of joy, gameplay you did not expect, frustation, or new ways of playing that could add to the game
- Do this with as many people as possible (3 minimum)
- From these notes, place a set of action items on your collaboration board
